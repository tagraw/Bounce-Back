# BounceBack — Reclaim Your Time, Reconnect Your Life

> "Because it’s never too late to bounce back."

BounceBack is a full-stack social reintegration app designed to support individuals—like Melissa—who are ready to reclaim the time they lost to early responsibilities or life challenges. This project merges personalization, community, and gamification into a single platform that encourages users to pursue goals and make new connections.
